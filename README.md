# ChaetocerosImgSeg
Unsupervised Pixel-wise Classification for Chaetoceros Image Segmentation.

# Notes
A new Chaetoceros image dataset and all segmentation results of our work can be downloaded from: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1K3T0CrRuSL56LKonGFS1Og

# Usages
1. You need to follow the README files and recompile the files in "source" or "lib" folders by yourself, because these files are some Mixed-Language Programming based on MATLAB and C++.

2. If the last element of a filename is digit, it indicates that you need to run this file according to the order of digit.

3. After you got all segmentation results, change the input file path of evaluation code according to different segmentation results paths.
